Serenade is a cross-platform music player that combines the flexibility of web technologies with the performance of native code.

## Key Features
*   **Cross-Platform Architecture**: Built using Electron for the UI and C# .NET Core for high-performance audio processing.
*   **Audio Visualization**: Implemented dynamic audio visualizations using the Web Audio API.
*   **Seamless Integration**: Coordinated integration between the React UI and local .NET backend services.

## Technical Details
I architected the application to ensure low-latency audio playback while maintaining a responsive and modern user interface. The backend handles file system operations and audio decoding, exposing a local API that the Electron frontend consumes.
