## Research Theme
Agentic AI refers to intelligent systems capable of autonomously pursuing complex goals with minimal human supervision. Closely aligned is Multi-Modal Intelligence, which empowers AI to interpret diverse data modalities. This research proposes to harness these two frontier areas to build next-generation intelligent systems for IoT and Industry 4.0, capable of operating in dynamic, sensor-rich environments.

## Problem Statement
*   **Limitations of Current AI:** Traditional AI systems in industry often lack adaptability and contextual understanding.
*   **Siloed Systems:** Most implementations are limited to single-modality data processing and reactive logic.
*   **The Need:** Adaptive AI agents capable of integrating visual, sensor, language, and numerical data into real-time decisions.

## Thesis Statement
This research proposes the development of a learning-based, multi-modal agentic AI framework capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting autonomously in IoT-enabled industrial environments. The goal is to design AI agents that learn from interactions over time to adapt their behavior intelligently.

## Methodology
*   **Problem Definition & Data Handling:** Defining application scenarios and developing robust methods for multi-modal data fusion.
*   **Architecture & Algorithm Design:** Designing a modular framework with perception modules, reasoning capabilities, and a core learning engine (Reinforcement Learning).
*   **Simulation-Based Development:** Training agents in environments like Gazebo/ROS or NVIDIA Isaac.
*   **Hardware Considerations:** Optimizing for edge computing platforms like NVIDIA Jetson.
*   **Human-AI Collaboration:** Investigating frameworks for effective human-agent teaming.

## Desired Outcomes
1.  Learning-based multi-modal agentic AI frameworks with superior autonomy and adaptability.
2.  Enhanced Industrial Productivity and Efficiency.
3.  Increased Safety and Resilience in industrial settings.
