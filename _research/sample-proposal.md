title: "Optimizing Cloud Resource Allocation using ML"
abstract: "This research proposes a novel machine learning approach to predict resource usage in Kubernetes clusters to minimize waste and cost."
methodology: "We will collect metrics from Prometheus, train an LSTM model on historical usage data, and integrate it with a custom Kubernetes scheduler to dynamically adjust resource requests."
outcomes: "Expected reduction in cloud infrastructure costs by 15% and improved application latency during traffic spikes."

## Introduction
Cloud computing offers scalability, but static resource allocation often leads to over-provisioning. This proposal aims to solve this using predictive scaling.

## Background
Current autoscalers (HPA/VPA) are reactive. A proactive approach using Deep Learning can anticipate load changes.

## Timeline
*   **Phase 1:** Data Collection (Month 1-2)
*   **Phase 2:** Model Training (Month 3)
*   **Phase 3:** Integration & Testing (Month 4)
